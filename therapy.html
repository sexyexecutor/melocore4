            <h3>What exactly does a psychotherapist do?</h3>
            <p>A psychotherapist focuses on gaining insight into a person's thought processes, and how these may be influenced by past events such that they cause problems in the present. A psychotherapist will work with the client to address the root cause and core issues of current problems so that lasting change and personal growth may occur.</p>
